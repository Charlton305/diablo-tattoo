She refined her artistic foundations during five years of study at the Kent Institute of Art and Design, an experience that shaped both her technical skill and her distinctive creative voice.\n\nA lifelong painter, Leonnie draws inspiration from the outdoors, developing a particular passion for outdoor and watercolour landscape painting.

Her artistic versatility, paired with her thoughtful storytelling approach, makes her a sought-after artist for clients looking for both creativity and craftsmanship.\n\nWhen she's not in the studio, Leonnie enjoys staying active—often found at the gym or out bike riding, activities that keep her energised and continually inspired.",
