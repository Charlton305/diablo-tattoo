  "bio": "Nathan is the Studio Manager and primary point of contact at the tattoo studio, overseeing bookings for all resident artists and ensuring each client's experience runs smoothly from first enquiry to final appointment. With a strong understanding of the artists' styles and specialties, Nathan carefully matches clients with the right artist for their vision.\n\nHe also leads one-on-one consultations, helping clients refine their ideas, choose the right design and size, and feel confident in every step of the process before tattoo day. His approachable manner and attention to detail make him an essential part of creating a welcoming, professional studio environment.\n\nOutside the studio, Nathan spends his downtime playing bass in his bands, playing video games, exploring photography, and socialising—bringing the same creativity and connection into his work at the studio.",
